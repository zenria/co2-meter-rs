# co2-meter-rs

Reads data from Winsen MH-Z19 CO2 sensors, publish them though MQTT. 

Target: 
- sensor host running the project: Raspberry PI + Winsen MH-Z19 plugged to the GPIO serial port
- reporting backend: MQTT + Jeedom

Part of this code tries to be a bit generic so it might be a good working base for IOT stuff running on raspberry
